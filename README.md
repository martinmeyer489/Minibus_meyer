# Masterthesis: "Design of suburban automated public transport networks using agent-based micro simulation"

This repository was originally a clone from the original [MATSim Minibus Contrib](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/tree/master/contribs/minibus),
which was developed by [Neumann, A (2014)](https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/publications/vspwp/2011/11-15/trb_paratransit_submitted_12nov11.pdf).

The extensions made by [Manser] (https://github.com/manserpa/minibus) were adopted and transformed in the MATSim version 13. The paper [Manser, P. (2017)](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/baug/ivt/ivt-dam/publications/students/501-600/sa575.pdf) provides an overview of the extensions made by Manser compared to the original code by Neumann.



It is extended for the specific use-case of reproducing and optimizing the formal public transport network of the city of Zurich. The results can be accessed in 




## Software

The code is very specifically tailored to the Zurich-application.




Persons who are interested in applying the software using another scenario are very welcome to ask the author of this repository.
